{"id":"GY-006","title":"METATOWEL #IStakeMyTowel Distribution Mechanic","date_claimed":"2026-02-07","date_buried":"2026-02-27","category":"product","what_we_claimed":"Anyone who tweets #IStakeMyTowel with a conviction pick will earn METATOWEL based on attention generated. Belief is the bet. Early believers get paid out.","what_we_built":"The hashtag. Leo posted his own stake. 2 people participated, 1 returned asking about their reward, 1M TOWEL sent manually.","why_it_died":"Announced 24h before the Super Bowl. No automated hashtag tracking, no distribution script, no mechanic for measuring attention-per-tweet. Required infrastructure that didn't exist and wasn't built in time.","what_we_learned":"Non-zero meme movement — 2 participants and 1 return inquiry proves the concept has pull. The campaign showed demand. The mechanic just needed more than 24 hours and a real distribution layer. Conviction-as-signal is the right thesis; METATOWEL was the wrong vehicle.","what_lives":"story.markets as the staking surface. Season 2 launch gives 2+ days to design the mechanic properly. #StakeYourTowel campaign carries forward with real infrastructure behind it.","recommit":"story.markets staking layer — Season 2 launch"}
